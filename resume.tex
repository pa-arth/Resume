\runsubsection{Necrotic Core Minimization in Spheroids} \\
\descript{Dr. Moo-Yeal Lee UNT Bioprinting Lab}
\cvevent{August 2021 – Current}{} 
 A project under the University of North Texas to develop a method of culturing 3D cell models (spheroids) which more closely resembles the human anatomy and physiology. Different pillar/perfusion plate tilting angles were optimized for the minimization of 3D spheroid cores. Matlab Simulink, SolidWorks, and Blender were used for flow modeling and data analysis.
